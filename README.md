Version 2 of the original Cooler Master RGB app. Each effect has settings which can be used to customise each effect and each effect can also be set to run when the machine is locked.<br>

For people who would like to just use the app without developing it I have included an EXE folder. Simply copy the .exe and .dll into your desired location and launch the app. Current .exe version: v1.0.01<br> 

* Current Effects:
  * Line by line
  * Alternating lines
  * Snake line by line
  * Spiral
  * Wipe
  * Breathing
  * Random 
  * Random lines 
  * Random squares
  * Random selected lines
  * Ball
  * Color cycle
  * Vertical rainbow
  * Rainbow
  * Rainbow Framed
  * Keypress
  * Trails
